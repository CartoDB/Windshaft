In order to run the performance test you need:

 1. A running redis (or Windshaft server will choke and abort)
    The redis server must be listening on the port written
    in the ../../config/environment/test.js file, for example:
    $ echo "port 6333" | redis-server - > /tmp/redis-test.log &

 2. A database listening on the port written in the same
    environment file, with some spatial table in it (the geometry
    field name is also written in the environment file)

How to run the test:

 1. Run the server, and put in the background:
    ./test_server.js &
    Will tell you something like: "Windshaft tileserver started on port 8080"
    Take note of the port number. Optionally redirect output to a log file
    to avoid console cluttering (but make sure to take note of port number).

 2. Run the actual benchmark:
    ./benchmark.js http://localhost:PORT/database/DBNAME/table/TABLENAME
    PORT is where tileserver started on.
    DBNAME and TABLENAME are the source of data you want to get tiles of.
    NOTE: you can also add the full url to a tile, including any parameter
    (api_key, style, sql, ...); the tool will take care of figuring out
    the structure of the call for you.
